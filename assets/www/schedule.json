We will pause here and there to look into concepts such as segmentation offloading, TCP small queues, and low latency polling.

Almost everything in Eclipse is implemented as an Eclipse plug-in in one way or another. These components provide a myriad of specialized functionality and Extension Points allowing the gifted developer to implement almost anything they've set their mind to.<br /><br />In this hands-on lab some of the cool new features of Eclipse Kepler are demonstrated. Have you ever considered using Eclipse CDT + Linux Tools for C/C++ development? CDT + Linux Tools bring profiling and memory corruption detection support directly into your IDE. Are you a Java developer using Eclipse? How efficient are you browsing the code base you are working on day-to-day? Learn how to use Eclipse's core features in order to increase your productivity as a Java developer. Did you know that E4, the new face of Eclipse, allows you to make your Eclipse based application look the way you want it to look? Gone are the days where you could spot Eclipse based applications right away. With E4 and CSS you can achieve this by simply shipping your own CSS file along with your application.<br /><br />This session also gives an introduction to developing an Eclipse Plug-in.

You can show up at our weekly IRC meeting and get \"fi-apprentice\" rights to log in to machines.<br /> - Signed, but unencrypted.  Anyone can read, anyone can write.  Only some messages are trusted.  Key here is that anyone can debug at any point in our infrastructure.<br /> - No central broker.  Datacenters are donated and distributed.  Things can go down.  fedmsg designed to not bring *anything* down with it.<br /> - Public zmq.PUB socket.  The world can read at ``tcp://hub.fedoraproject.org:9940`` -- point a ``zmq.SUB`` socket at it with ``recv_multipart``.<br /><br />- CLI tools and API examples<br /><br /> - CLI: ``echo \"hello world\" | fedmsg-logger``<br /> - CLI: ``fedmsg-tail --really-pretty``<br /> - API: ``fedmsg.publish(...)``<br /> - API: ``fedmsg.tail_messages(...)``<br /><br />- Applications built against fedmsg<br /><br /> - fedmsg-notifications. -- Problem: all of our applications carry their own email code. With that comes further baggage and maintenance.<br /> With fedmsg notifications for interesting infrastructure events, we can put all that code in one place where it can be more easily maintained.<br /> Benefit to the end-user: manage notification preferences in one place instead of per-app.<br /> Opens up notifications to different contexts:  Email? IRC privmsg? Android? RSS?<br /><br /> - Push to test/qa infrastructure.<br /> When new packages are built, we can instantly run depchain analysis tests.  This is was done previously with cronjobs.<br /> When new composes are complete, we can fire off jobs in beaker to make sure install and integration tests pass.  This was done previously by hand.<br /><br /> - Push notifications to mirrors<br /> Over 200 mirrors right now.  They have cronjobs that poll with rsync, we can use ``fedmsg-trigger`` to fire off rsync only when the compose notification is published.<br /><br /> - Sync apprentice and packager credentials<br /> Ugly cronjobs exist that run that sync shell groups to machines from the Fedora Account System.  With ``fedmsg-trigger``, we fire off an ansible playbook to sync creds when group-membership-change messages are published.<br /> Same goes for package ownership and ACL changes.  People had to wait up to an hour for their creds to propagate.<br /><br /> - Visualizations - Faking git logs for \"gource\".<br /> Run \"fedmsg-tail --gource | gource -i 0 --log-format custom -\" to get the realtime version of [this](http://threebean.org/so-i-turned-the-fedmsg-data-into-a-git-log-and.webm).<br /> Its the best office dashboard ever.<br /><br /> - Reports - fedora-news, this-week-in-fedora, owner-change-tool, &amp; release engineering dashboard.<br /> HTML5 dashboards that query the history of fedmsg to make useful reports.<br /> http://ambre.pingoured.fr/fedora-news/<br /> http://ambre.pingoured.fr/thisweekinfedora/<br /> https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-June/013070.html<br /> https://apps.stg.fedoraproject.org/releng-dash/<br /><br /> - Fedora Badges for distro contributors<br /> https://badges.fedoraproject.org<br /> Backends listens to the bus and wakes up in response to new events.<br /> Compares messages against a series of 100 or so rules defined in YAML.  If a<br /> contributor matches some criteria, then they are awarded a badge (achievement<br /> unlocked!)<br /> Fun fact -- this is hooked into Mozilla's Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI).  https://openbadges.org/<br /><br />- Debian adoption - Imagine a multi-distro realtime development pony<br /><br /> - This is amazing.  Their bus is still coming up but they have a ton of message types already passing over it.<br /> - They too have a publicly subscribable endpoint.  Your end user machine can subscribe to *both* the Fedora and the Debian buses.<br /> - Imagine this scenario:  a security bug gets filed in Debian.  A Fedora daemon listens to their bus and automatically files the same bug on our tracker against the same package (perhaps it is smart and checks for dupes first).<br /> - A new package update is marked as a security fix in Fedora, a debian daemon listens and tries to check if the same patch is applied there.  If not, it emails the maintainer to find out whats up.<br /> - We just started talking about a Holy Grail - integrating compatible semantic DOAP and FOAF information with all messages so we can easily correlate activity between the distributions.<br /> - Can we provide a service to upstreams?  Aim your github service hook at some bucket service.  When you tag a new release, it notifies the upstream-bucket, the upstream-bucket notifies anyone who wants to know (Fedora, Debian, &amp; friends)."}, {"end": "10:30", "room": "Lecture room D2", "language": "EN", "tags": ["Networking"], "timestamp": 1391935800, "topic": "DNSSEC (not only) on workstations", "start": "09:50", "speaker": "Tomas Hozza", "location": "MUNI", "date": "2014-02-09", "timestamp_end": 1391938200, "type": "talk", "description": "The support of DNSSEC in server software it pretty good, but there are still missing parts of DNSSEC support in client side software.
