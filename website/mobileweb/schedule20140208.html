				<p class="list-group-item-text">JGroups is a messaging framework which allows developers to create reliable messaging (one-to-one or one-to-many) applications where reliability is a deployment issue, and does not have to be implemented by the application developer.<br />The most powerful feature of JGroups is its flexible protocol stack, which allows developers to adapt it to exactly match their application requirements and network characteristics.<br />The benefit of this is that you only pay for what you use. By mixing and matching protocols, various differing application requirements can be satisfied.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">It's no secret that Linux runs much of the Internet, as well as all sorts of infrastructure and servers. In large part that's due to our community, and the great projects we've worked on together.<br /><br />Where we've fallen short, is making these technologies accessible. Non-expert administrators often don't know where to start to make use of the powerful stuff we've put together. This ends up preventing further use of Linux.<br /><br />Enter Cockpit. It aims to be a lightweight, installed out of the box, interface for performing basic monitoring, configuration, and installation on Linux servers.<br /><br />Perfect for bringing new sysadmins to Linux, but we also aim to make repetitive tasks work well for experts, and respect and integrate well with other configuration tools out there, including the terminal.<br /><br />In the talk we'll talk about why the Cockpit project was started, how Cockpit works, including its networking and multi-server aspects, and how you can get involved, try it out. We'll have a demo to show you were things are at, and some discussion of where we're headed.</p>

Give some examples and describe how can we benefit from it even more when taking advantage of storage capabilities. And also how to improve support for advanced types of storage from within<br />the file systems.<br /><br />In short I'll try to touch topics regarding data and metadata checksumming, file level and block level snapshotting, thin provisioning, user-guided allocation and possibly some of the newer types of storage such as non-volatile memory or hybrid drives.</p>

In this talk the new GC named Shenandoah will be discussed. Shenandoah, which is being developed at Red Hat, is an ultra-low pause time collection algorithm targeting sub 10ms pause times for 100+GB heaps. The goal of this project is to reduce GC pause times on extremely large heaps and make pause times independent from the heap size.</p>

Now with a very strong enterprise focus, it gained additional security properties with strong encryption, signatures and the ability to anonymize log files. Also, the upcoming version 8 provides strong new features and scalability and performance enhancements.This talk will describe the new features, why they were introduced and how they are implemented. Most importantly, the new v8 engine and output module interface will be described. The interface has totally been revamped and plugin authors need to abide to the new interface in order to be compatible with v8. We also describe why this hard requirement was placed on plugins ... and how easy it usually is to convert v7 plugins.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">A lot of people in the Java community has been long longing for some kind of a "Java.next" language, a language that will be modern yet keep the design spirit. There is a lot of more or less suitable candidates -- let's take a brief look at some of them and then examine Kotlin in more detail. Kotlin comes from JetBrains, a company with more than 10 years of experience developing industry-leading developer tools and therefore pretty unique perspective on language design. We'll take a look at some of the more interesting features: null-safety and other nice little things in the type system, language-supported delegation, lambdas, extension methods and DSL support. Few words about Java interop too.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">In contrast to later OS designs Unix/Linux since its beginning has not provided a standardized, high-level IPC system as part of its system APIs. It has provided various primitives such as AF_UNIX sockets, FIFOs, and various forms of shared memory and synchronization facilities, but it always lacked an established mechanisms for secure, introspectable, standardized local RPC with multicasting signalling. Various attempts have been made to build such a system on top of the available primitives, the most important and successful project being D-Bus. D-Bus brought standardization and introspectability however being designed for exchanging control messages only, brings serious performance issues when it is used to deliver payload.<br /><br />In this talk we'll discuss "kdbus", our attempt to move D-Bus into the kernel layer, to make it truly universal, and how it is integrated into systemd and its APIs. kdbus brings scalabale, secure, high performance IPC on the kernel level, while staying compatible with classic D-Bus in most ways. From the beginning it has been designed to provide single-copy and zero-copy communication, and namespacing and sandboxing has been designed into it from the beginning.<br /><br />When designing "kdbus" we took a lot of inspiration from IPC systems in the Operating Systems, including most importantly Android Binder, Mach Ports, Solaris Doors, and QNX IPC, which we will cover in this talk too.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">QEMU, the virtual machine monitor typically used with KVM, has long supported thin provisioning through both sparse raw files and the qcow2 image format. However, for thin provisioning to help both virtual machine users and host administrators, it must be supported throughout the whole virtualization stack: the guest (userspace and kernel), the host (QEMU, management interface, kernel), the storage itself. This talk will show how we implemented thin provisioning in all these layers and how the results benefit our users.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">Standard code coverage analysis provides insight into execution paths exercised by a testing scheme. Mutation testing takes this notion a step further and offers a deep down investigation (through code modification or removal) of the impact each line of production code makes on the whole test. This approach has been known for over 30 years circling mainly within academic communities and only recently has it been rediscovered and introduced to the benefit of commercial solutions. Mutation testing technique which focuses on partitioning the code on per line basis with regards to influence on the logic put under test provides actual (as opposed to artificial and synthetic) view on tests quality.<br /><br />The presentation will provide solutions and answers to the following:<br /> 
<ul>
<li>What is mutation testing?</li>
<li>Why use it?</li>
<li>Limitations and drawbacks</li>
<li>Why only now does it start to get traction?</li>
<li>How to prepare your project for mutation testing?</li>
<li>Is there a case for it in the enterprise?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />This presentation is meant for software development-involved individuals who want to learn more about mutation testing, what advantages over traditional coverage scheme it offers and how to apply the idea to their existing codebase. Although not required, some knowledge on test automation and coverage would be beneficial to the attendee.<br /><br />The introduction to mutation testing will be language agnostic. Presented tools can be used only with Java code.&nbsp;</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">Security compliance is conformance to security requirements that are usually defined either by industry standards (USGCB, DISA STIG, PCI DSS) or custom policies specified by an organization itself. Unfortunately reaching the compliance is not that easy. Some of the issues users may run into are:<br /> * lack of a security guidances, checklists, and associated validation mechanisms<br /> * lack of high quality (as in certified) scanners - auditing tools<br /> * difficulties with security profiles customization<br /> * missing remediation capability in current standards (remediation allow users to alter system configuration in order to put system into compliance)<br /> * integration with system management solutions that can facilitate monitoring and reporting<br /><br />In this talk we will introduce various components (scanner, data, installer and systems management solution) that comes into play when we deal with these kind of challenges. We will also describe work-flow these components have established and we will show you where and how you can start contributing in order to make the security compliance more suitable for your needs. Our main focus will be on contribution to the compliance requirements repository which is hosted by the scap-security-guide project.</p>

Virtio offers an extensible and openalternative to emulating proprietary hardware. Virtio is also finding useoutside its traditional virtualization role as a way to provide device accesson new hardware architectures.This talk covers the VIRTIO 1.0 specification which is currently undergoing thestandardization process. It offers new performance improvements, integratesadditional hardware transports, and eliminates earlier design mistakes.The talk gives an overview of the virtio device model and design decisions inthe upcoming VIRTIO 1.0 specification. Developers and anyone interested invirtualization will gain an appreciation for how data is transported fromvirtual machines to physical disks or network adapters.</p>

				<p class="list-group-item-text">Contemporary user interface (UI) design tangles multiple different interests together, which results in increased efforts of its development and maintenance. In addition, information captured in backend parts of the system is being restated in the UI part, which negatively impacts maintenance and may cause its inconsistency. In this talk we present aspect-driven approach that suggests separating various UI interests and concerns, and enables their reuse among the system. This runtime approach allows us to reduce development and maintenance efforts, mitigate inconsistency errors, and to build low effort adaptive UIs. Our open-source framework is deployed in production at Java EE 6 application at ACM-ICPC system. We present benefits of this concept, experiences received from its production use and impact on system maintenance.</p>
